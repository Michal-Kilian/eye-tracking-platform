# Eye Tracking Platform

Eye-tracking is a technology that monitors the movement of an 
individual's eyes. Recording a person's gaze data helps us understand 
their visual attention and provides valuable information about the user's 
cognitive processes and behaviour. It is currently gaining popularity and 
is the subject of significant technological advances. Due to the lack of 
affordable solutions, there was a need to create an efficient and 
accessible platform usable for eye-tracking.
